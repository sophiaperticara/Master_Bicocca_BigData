This repo contains slides and code of an individual project I made during the Master course I have been attending @ Bicocca since April 2021.

I did Tweets Web Scraping concerning European Football Championship (#EURO2021) in order to understand what the most retweeted Tweets talked about, what were the most popular hashtags and who was mentioned the most.
As a first step, through Tweepy Python library, I retrieved Tweets as many as I could (I started about 1 week before the Project deadline) , using a list of very simple and popular Hashtags, like EURO2020 or EURO2021. 
Second step was concerning restructuring scraped data and storing them in a Python dataframe, extracting and cleaning tweets, with a particular regard of Tweets about Italy National Team.

I highly recommend using Visual Studio Code, downloading ChromeDriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) on your local notebook.
